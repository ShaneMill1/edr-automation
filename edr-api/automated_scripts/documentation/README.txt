The first bit of code takes all the parameters contained in the concatenated grib files (which contains 0z,06z,12z,18z run, and creates a csv that has the associated long name, level type, and all dimensions. It creates almost a mask where the dimensions associated with each parameter are displayed. For this, see GFS.csv Next, for each parameter, we look at the associated dimensions. Every parameter with matching dimensions is grouped together. Column X shows the grouping. This is a messy csv file but is needed to get to the final product. See GFS_grouping.csv for this.Finally, from the grouping, we can now create a csv containing the Coverage IDs, Parameter list, Number of dimensions, and the associated dimension names. For this, see GFS_collection.csvGFS_collection.csv can also be outputted as JSON. This is really good to see the collections in a hierarchical structure, so check that out with GFS_collection.json
